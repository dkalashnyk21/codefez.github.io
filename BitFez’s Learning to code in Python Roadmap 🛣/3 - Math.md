As well as displaying text, programming languages will also work out math. An example of this could be:

Earlier on in [[1 - Printing Basics]], I wrote that `print` is a function. You can tell a function in Python because it has parenthesis `( )`.

## Operators

|Operator|Python symbol|
|---|---|
|+|+|
|-|-|
|x|*|
|÷|/|

In the above example, Python is evaluating everything between the parenthesis. Have you noticed that `2+2 * 2` is 6? You probably learned about BIDMAS (or BODMAS) in math lessons. multiplication happens before addition in the order of operations.

### Tasks

Try some maths in python

- [ ] 100*10
- [ ] 10/2
- [ ] 10*2*2
- [ ] 7.5*2

  

## Some more operators

A couple more operators you will need to learn are the DIV and MOD operators. These are often useful in programming and frequently come up in exam questions.

|Operator|Operator|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|MOD|%|remainder (or modular) division only shows the remainder of any division.|
|DIV|//|integer (or floor) division removes the decimal point and remainder of any division.|
|equal to|==|This is a _comparative operator_. You will learn more about these in the coming lessons. It is used to compare 1 object to another object.|

### Tasks

write print statements to

- [ ] result in a remainder of 2 (eg. 10 MOD 4)
- [ ] result in a remainder of 1 (eg. 10 MOD 3)
- [ ] result in a floor division of 2
- [ ] result in a floor division of 3

  

## Evaluating to `True` or `False`

All operations in a computer eventually boil down to whether a process is:

- `True` or `False`
- `0` or `1`
- `on` or `off`

  

We can use the comparative operator `==` to evaluate whether statements are `True` or `False`

### Tasks

- [ ] 2*7-2==12 → `True`
- [ ] 14+2/2 ==7 → `False`
- [ ] “2+2”==4 → `False`
- [ ] Solve the above so that 2+2*2 == 8 without changing the order of the numbers. 💡 think BIDMAS
