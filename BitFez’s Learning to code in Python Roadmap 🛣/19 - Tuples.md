A tuple is very similar to a list except that items cannot be appended, removed or re-assigned!

You may have read the Isaac Asimov books “Runaround**”, “**_I, Robot__**”**_ or seen the film adaptation. He introduced **The Three Laws Of Robotics** which were:

> **First Law  
>   
> **A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  
>   
> **Second Law  
>   
> **A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  
>   
> **Third Law  
>   
> **A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

  

It would make sense to hardcode these rules in to robots using a tuple right? You wouldn’t want that rule changed.

  

A tuple is written using parenthesis instead of square brackets

```Python
bitFez_laws = ("Stay in school", "Be good to your parents", "Stay cool")
```

  

Items can be accessed in the same way.

```Python
print(bitFez_laws[0])
```
