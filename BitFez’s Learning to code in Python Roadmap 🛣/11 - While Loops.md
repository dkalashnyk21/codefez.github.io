Like its cousin, the `for` loop, `while` loops are about repetition. The main difference here is that we can use while loops when we are not sure of how many times repetition needs to take place.

For example, If I wanted to send a message to everyone in my class, I probably know how many students there are. Therefore, I could use a _for loop_.

However, if I wanted to keep music running in a game until the game was over, that may be a different length of time, based on how skillful the player is.

  

# How does it work

Similar to an `if` statement, there needs to be a condition in a while loop. for example:

```Python
lives = 3

while lives >= 0:
		gameRunning = True
```

## Heads up!

It's very important to get your operators correct when using a while loop. You could be left in an infinite loop until your program crashes! See the example below

The same could happen if the counter is not incremented/decremented

# Tasks

- [ ] There is an example above of counting from 1 to 10.  
    Create a while loop to count down from 10 to 1  
    
- [ ] Complete this task simulating a while loop in a kettle [while_task 1 - Replit](https://replit.com/@bitFez/whiletask-1#main.py)
- [ ] Create a loop that will ask a user for their name infinitely unless the name is Batman. At which point the program should reply... `No, I'm batman`.
- [ ] Look at this code and re-write it with a `while` loop.

```Python
for number in range(1, 11):
		print(f"{number} x 5 = {number*5}")
```
